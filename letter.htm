    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        Seven years of laughter, chaos, fights, healing, late-night talks, silent understandings,
        and the kind of memories that don’t fade — they become part of who we are.
    </p>

    <p>
        Turanya, loving you has never been just a chapter of my life.
        It has been the whole journey.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve seen our ups. We’ve survived our downs.
        We’ve grown, stumbled, learned, forgiven, and held on — every single time.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are my comfort.  
        You are my peace.  
        You are my happiest place.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world that constantly changes, you have been my constant.
        In moments when life felt heavy, you were my calm.
        In times of confusion, you were my clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seven years with you don’t feel like time passing —
        they feel like a story still being written.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are not just the girl I love.
        You are the person I choose — every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter where life takes us,
        as long as I’m walking beside you,
        I’m already home.
    </p>
