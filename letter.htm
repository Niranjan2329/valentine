    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        Seven years of laughter, chaos, fights, healing, late-night talks, silent understandings,
        and the kind of memories that don’t fade — they become part of who we are.
    </p>

    <p>
        Turanya, loving you has never been just a chapter of my life.
        It has been the whole journey.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve seen our ups.
        We’ve survived our downs.
        We’ve grown, stumbled, learned, forgiven, and held on — every single time.
    </p>

    <p>
        And through everything, one thing has never changed:
    </p>

    <p>
        You are my comfort.<br>
        You are my peace.<br>
        You are my happiest place.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world that constantly changes, you have been my constant.
        In moments when life felt heavy, you were my calm.
        In times of confusion, you were my clarity.
        In all my adventures, you were my favorite part.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seven years with you don’t feel like time passing —
        they feel like a story still being written.
    </p>

    <p>
        A story full of inside jokes, emotional conversations, stupid arguments,
        deep love, and the kind of bond that only becomes stronger with every storm.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are not just the girl I love.
        You are the person I choose — every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        And if these seven years have taught me anything, it’s this:
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter where life takes us,
        as long as I’m walking beside you,
        I’m already home.
    </p>
